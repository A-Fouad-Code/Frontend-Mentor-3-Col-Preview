# Frontend Mentor 3 Column Preview

### Intro

I found this challenge on [Frontend mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/3column-preview-card-component-pH92eAR2-)
I solved it using HTML and CSS only.

### Process

I started this challenge by creating a grid of 3 cols.
Inside each col I created a container and gave it ` display: flex `.
For media querries I changed the grid layout from 3 cols to only 1,
which made it work with ease relative to other ways.

### Summary

If you have any comments on my code or see place where it could be improved please share your thoughts with me.
